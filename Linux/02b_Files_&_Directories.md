### 1. **`ls` (List Files and Directories)**
This command shows you whatâ€™s inside a folder (directory).

#### Basic Command:
```bash
ls
```

#### Example:
Letâ€™s say youâ€™re in a folder with files called **"homework.txt"**, **"games"** (a folder), and **"notes.pdf"**.
```bash
ls
```
Output:
```
homework.txt  games  notes.pdf
```

#### Flags (Options):
- **`-l`**: Shows a detailed list (long format) with file permissions, sizes, and dates.
- **`-a`**: Shows **all** files, including hidden ones (files that start with a dot `.`).

#### Real Example:
```bash
ls -la
```
Output:
```
drwxr-xr-x  2 user user 4096 Nov 12 08:00 games
-rw-r--r--  1 user user  256 Nov 12 08:00 homework.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 user user 1024 Nov 12 08:00 notes.pdf
```

---

### 2. **`pwd` (Print Working Directory)**
This command tells you **where you are** in the folder structure (like your current address).

#### Basic Command:
```bash
pwd
```

#### Example:
If youâ€™re in a folder called **"/home/user/Documents"**, typing `pwd` will show you:
```bash
/home/user/Documents
```
This tells you that you're in the "Documents" folder.

---

### 3. **`cd` (Change Directory)**
This command lets you **move** from one folder to another.

#### Basic Command:
```bash
cd folder_name
```

#### Example:
Letâ€™s say youâ€™re in **"/home/user"** and you want to go to your **Documents** folder:
```bash
cd Documents
```
Now youâ€™re inside **"/home/user/Documents"**.

#### Flags (Options):
- **`cd ..`**: Move **up** one level (back to the parent directory).
- **`cd ~`**: Go to your **home** folder (usually **/home/username**).

#### Real Example:
```bash
cd ..
```
This takes you one folder up.

---

### 4. **`mkdir` (Make Directory)**
This command creates a new folder.

#### Basic Command:
```bash
mkdir folder_name
```

#### Example:
If you want to create a folder called **"school"**:
```bash
mkdir school
```
Now you have a new folder called **"school"**.

#### Flags (Options):
- **`-p`**: Creates parent directories if they donâ€™t exist.

#### Real Example:
```bash
mkdir -p projects/2024/school
```
This creates the folder **"projects"**, inside it a folder **"2024"**, and inside that, a folder called **"school"** all in one command!

---

### 5. **`touch` (Create an Empty File)**
This command makes an **empty file** (like a blank piece of paper).

#### Basic Command:
```bash
touch file_name
```

#### Example:
If you want to create an empty file called **"notes.txt"**:
```bash
touch notes.txt
```
Now you have an empty file named **"notes.txt"**.

#### Flags (Options):
- **`touch -a`**: Change only the fileâ€™s **access time** (when it was last opened).
- **`touch -m`**: Change only the fileâ€™s **modification time** (when it was last changed).

---

### 6. **`cp` (Copy Files and Directories)**
This command copies files or folders from one place to another.

#### Basic Command:
```bash
cp source destination
```

#### Example:
If you want to copy **"homework.txt"** to a folder called **"backup"**:
```bash
cp homework.txt backup/
```
Now, there will be a copy of **"homework.txt"** inside the **backup** folder.

#### Flags (Options):
- **`-r`**: Copy a directory **recursively** (which means it copies everything inside the folder too).
- **`-i`**: Asks for confirmation before overwriting any files.
- **`-v`**: Verbose mode (shows whatâ€™s happening during the copy).

#### Real Example:
```bash
cp -rv games backup/
```
This copies the **games** folder and everything inside it to the **backup** folder and shows the process as it happens.

---

### 7. **`mv` (Move or Rename Files and Directories)**
This command moves or renames files or folders.

#### Basic Command:
```bash
mv source destination
```

#### Example 1 (Move):
If you want to move **"notes.txt"** into the **Documents** folder:
```bash
mv notes.txt Documents/
```
Now **"notes.txt"** is inside the **Documents** folder.

#### Example 2 (Rename):
If you want to rename **"notes.txt"** to **"classnotes.txt"**:
```bash
mv notes.txt classnotes.txt
```
Now the file is called **"classnotes.txt"**.

#### Flags (Options):
- **`-i`**: Asks for confirmation before overwriting.
- **`-v`**: Shows whatâ€™s happening during the move.

---

### 8. **`rm` (Remove Files and Directories)**

```

#### Example:
If you want to delete **"oldnotes.txt"**:
```bash
rm oldnotes.txt
```
Now the file is deleted.

#### Flags (Options):
- **`-r`**: Remove directories **recursively** (deletes the folder and everything inside it).
- **`-i`**: Asks for confirmation before deleting.
- **`-f`**: Forces deletion without asking (dangerous!).
  
#### Real Example:
```bash
rm -r backup/
```
This deletes the **backup** folder and everything inside it.

---

### 9. **`cat` (Display File Contents)**
This command shows the contents of a file.

#### Basic Command:
```bash
cat file_name
```

#### Example:
If you want to see whatâ€™s inside **"homework.txt"**:
```bash
cat homework.txt
```
This shows the text written in **"homework.txt"**.

#### Flags (Options):
- **`-n`**: Shows line numbers in the file.

---

### 10. **`nano` (Edit Files)**
This command opens a file for editing directly in the terminal.

#### Basic Command:
```bash
nano file_name
```

#### Example:
If you want to edit **"homework.txt"**, type:
```bash
nano homework.txt
```
This opens the file, and you can start typing or editing right away. Use **CTRL + X** to exit and **Y** to save changes.
